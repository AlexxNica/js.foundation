The jQuery Foundation's mission is to improve the open web, making it accessible for everyone, through the development and support of open source software, and collaboration with the development community.

The Foundation supports some of the most important [projects](#home-010-projects) in the JavaScript ecosystem and is always on the lookout for new projects and organizations to join our movement.
