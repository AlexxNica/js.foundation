The JS Foundation's mission is to drive widespread adoption and continued development of key JavaScript solutions and related technologies, facilitate collaboration within the JavaScript development community, create a center of gravity for open source projects throughout the end-to-end JavaScript ecosystem guiding them toward open governance and diverse collaborator bases, host the infrastructure to support open source JavaScript projects, and enable an open and accessible web through advancement of the JS Foundation's projects and strategic partnerships.

The JS Foundation supports some of the most important [projects](#home-010-projects) in the JavaScript ecosystem and is always on the lookout for new projects and organizations to join our movement.
