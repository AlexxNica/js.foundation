<p>Maggie works in the Open Source Programs office at Microsoft, where she helps people navigate Microsofts OSS ecosystem both by writing code to better automate open source processes, and by advocating OSS within the organization. In the past she has been a SQL Server DBA, a full stack .NET developer, and a project manager. In her non-Microsoft open source life, she is a maintainer of <a href="https://momentjs.com">Moment.js</a>, and an advocate for both the JavaScript open source community, and better handling of date and time in programming.</p>

<p>When she is not coding, Maggie enjoys spending time with her four-year-old son, drinking too much coffee, and showing and breeding Australian Shepherds.</p>
