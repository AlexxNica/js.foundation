## Change control process

We're (mostly) programmers, so we'll track changes to the Code of Conduct and associated documents the same way we track changes to code. All changes will be proposed via a pull request to the [js.foundation repository on GitHub][]. Changes will be reviewed by the [conduct committee][] first, and then sent to the JS Foundation, the development teams, and the community for comment. We'll hold a comment period of at least one week, and then each group will vote on the change using its normal process (a board for the JS Foundation and project leads for the dev teams). Approved changes will be merged, published, and noted below.

This only applies to material changes; changes that don't affect the intent (typo fixes, re-wordings, etc.) can be made immediately.
