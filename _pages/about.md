Developers rely on a growing portfolio of open source technologies to create, test and deploy critical applications. By creating a center of gravity for the open source JavaScript ecosystem, the JS Foundation's mission is to drive broad adoption and ongoing development of key JavaScript solutions and related technologies and to facilitate collaboration within the JavaScript development community to ensure those projects maintain the quality and diverse contribution bases that provide for long-term sustainability.


## Open

Open standards are publicly available and free to implement without ever having to worry about royalties and are vital to the future of application development.

JS Foundation projects encourage adoption of open standards and implement tools to help developers apply those standards.


## Accessible

We believe that everyone should be able to access the vast content available on the web. This includes anyone with physical, mental, cognitive, or technological disabilities that make it more difficult to use the Internet. Content should be usable by people with poor network connections, slow or old devices, and assistive technologies.

JS Foundation projects emphasize the importance of accessibility to developers to facilitate the creation of accessible content and applications.


## Sustainable

Open source projects are a key part to the development tool chain and are the basis for many other projects, applications and products that developers and organizations depend on. Ensuring that those key projects in the JavaScript space are supported and maintained for the long term means these developers and organizations can trust that those dependencies will be there when they need them.

The JS Foundation provides the guidance and support necessary to ensure growing and diverse contributor bases that will deliver high quality, long-lived open source projects.
