title: "Governance"
---

The JS Foundation is governed by two branches which separate business and technical decisions. The Board of Directors leads the business branch and is composed of member representatives as well as a representative from the Technical Advisory Committee. The technical branch of governance handles all technical aspects of the Foundation, independent of the Board of Directors.

## Board of Directors

The Board of Directors (BoD) serves as the business guiding branch of governance and as such, they tackle tasks and decisions involving topics like marketing, legal, fundraising, and other business driving topics. They also define the strategic direction for the Foundation and set policies and procedures to enable the Foundation to work toward those strategic goals. The BoD also appoints officers who handle the administrative functions of the board such as scheduling and presiding over meetings (President), taking of minutes (Secretary), budgetary oversight (Treasurer) and other functions as necessary.

## Staff

The Board also appoints an Executive Director (ED) to run the Foundation on a day-to-day basis. The ED is tasked with contributing to the strategic initiatives set out by the Board, implementing those initiatives and then reporting back on their success. The ED has the authority, within the boundaries of the current budget, to hire staff and contractors or partner with other organizations to advance the Foundation toward its goals. The ED reports to the President of the Board with additional oversight and input from the full Board.

## Technical Advisory Committee

The Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) is responsible for ensuring collaboration is the driving principle within the JS Foundation, its Projects, between JS Foundation Projects, and between JS Foundation Projects and the broader community. The TAC is also responsible for admitting new projects to the mentorship program as well as graduating projects from the mentorship program. The TAC will serve as the JS Foundation's primary technical liaison body with external open source projects, consortiums and groups and is also responsible for technical participation in standards bodies. The TAC Chair sits on the Board of Directors and provides a conduit for communication between the business and technical governing bodies within the JS Foundation.
